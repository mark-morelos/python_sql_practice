'''
A valid postal code P have to fulfill both below requirements:
1. P must be a number in the range from 100000 to 999999 inclusive.
1. P must not contain more than one alternating repetitive digit pait.

Alternating repetitive digis are digits which repeat immediately after the next digit.
In other words, an alternating repetitive digit pair is formed by 2 equal digits that have just a
single digit between them

For example:
121426 # Here, 1 is an alternating repetitive digit.
523563 # Here, NO digit is an alternating repetitive digit.
552523 # Here, both 2 and 5 are alternating repetitive digits.

Your task is to provide two regular expressions regex_integer_in_range and
regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair. Where:
regex_integer_in_range should match only integers range from 100000 to 999999 inclusive
regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair should find alternating repetitive digits pairs in a given string.

Both these regular expressions will be used by the provided code template to check if the input string P
is a valid postal code using the following expression:
(bool(re.match(regex_integer_in_range, P))
and len(re.findall(regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair, P))<2)
'''

import re
regex_integer_in_range = r'^[1-9][\d]{5}$' # delimited expression inside of regex. will return the number of alternate matching pattern which should be at max 1
regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair = r'(\d)(?=\d\1)' # will take a pattern and a string but doesn't consume any of the string (lookahead assertion). ie Isaac (?=Asimov) will match 'Isaac ' only if itâ€™s followed by 'Asimov'

P = input()

print(bool(re.match(regex_integer_in_range, P)) and len(re.findall(regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair, P))<2)
